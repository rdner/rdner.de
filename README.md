## Contribution guide

This blog is rendered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) via GitHub Actions [automation](./.github/workflows/main.yml) into [./docs](./docs) directory which is the root for https://rdner.de. So, please treat [./docs](./docs) as read-only and don't push any changes in that directory yourself, the automation will take care of the actual rendering.

All the content is located in [./content](./content) as markdown files, please make the fixes there.

This blog is using the self-made Hugo theme that you can find here https://github.com/rdner/hugo-dark-pragma
