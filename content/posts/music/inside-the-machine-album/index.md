This album is my first ever experiment with producing music. The idea was to express in music how one would feel inside a busy computer processing signals and working hard. The focus was definitely on the percussion.

Just to manage your expectations: I had never produced any electronic music before I worked on this. I didn't try to match a certain genre or mimic someone, also most of the samples are taken from existing libraries.

The album consists of 4 instrumental tracks:
