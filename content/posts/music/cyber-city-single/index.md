This single was inspired by the [Ghost in the Shell](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1219827/) movie. I'm a big fan of the anime and went to see the movie. Although I didn't like how the story was changed, I appreciated the visuals and the original soundtrack.

* Guitar: modified [.strandberg* Boden OS7](/posts/music/strandberg-boden-os-7/)
