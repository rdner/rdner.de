This track was very long in the making.

I wrote the first version in March 2020 for my custom baritone guitar. The guitar tuning is actually Dropped A (A E A D F# B).

At that time I was still unsatisfied with some parts and took a break for some time. Later I was returning to writing now and then, and at some point it seemed finished. When it came to recording guitar, I really struggled. You see, I’m not practicing guitar that much. I use it as my music-writing instrument, but I’m not a good guitar player. It was very tough for me to play these parts, and this track turned out to be harder to record than I anticipated. I tried a few times but was never satisfied with the results. So, I abandoned this idea completely.

5 years later, my custom baritone guitar is no longer with me (sold). I still can’t play guitar very well, but I still think this work is worth being published.

So, I accepted the fact that I can’t play guitar. I’m not going to hire someone to play for me, and the only option left is to use synthesized instruments. Which I did. It turned out surprisingly okay. Of course, one can notice that guitars are not real, but at least everything sounds exactly like I would like it to sound. Everything is on time; all the notes are right.

The artwork is inspired by the [Legion](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5114356/) show and one of its posters.
