I've been a big fan of the [Ghost in the Shell](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113568/) anime for a long time. I also really liked the [Stand Alone Complex](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0346314/) show. So, when I learned that there would be a movie, I was very excited. I had so many ideas of what it could be, so many high expectations.

I went to see the movie and got very disappointed in the story the filmmakers chose to tell in [Ghost in the Shell](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1219827/) movie. Instead of taking a risk and telling a new story in that universe, they just took the best things from the original anime and the show I mentioned above and created a monster. Oh, well. At least visually, it was great.

Although I didn't like how the story was changed, I appreciated the visuals and the original soundtrack. This inspired me to write something on my own, and I got to work immediately after coming home.

What I used:

* Guitar: modified [.strandberg* Boden OS7](/posts/music/strandberg-boden-os-7/)
* Bass: Ibanez SR305EB-WK
* Guitar FX: Axe FX II
