I'm a Principal Software Engineer based in Germany with more than a decade of experience, ranging from binary protocols and device communication to high-scale front-end applications and back-end services. Although I've worked on user interfaces in the past, I found my passion in building complex distributed systems.

Outside of work, I [train for endurance sports](https://connect.garmin.com/modern/profile/ccb91222-2fcb-4ba6-87c6-efe33b58650e), [go on adventures](/posts/motorcycle/), [produce music](/music), [and take photos](https://www.icloud.com/sharedalbum/#B0vJ0DiRHGvpwq9).

You can reach me via email [denis@rdner.de](mailto:denis@rdner.de) or [Signal Messenger](https://signal.me/#eu/xY4pK8nc-wjz1P0pHUcmAtjj5hzyYPjP02V7vYCKMJMT287miVBOmqRId0U9zaAg).

Here is [my most recent CV](/cv.html).

# Open Source

I'm a firm believer in open source. I've created and maintained a relatively large open source project, and I'm currently working on open source as part of my daily job.

* [Elastic Agent](https://github.com/elastic/elastic-agent) — With Elastic Agent you can collect all forms of data from anywhere with a single unified agent per host. I'm a member of the maintaing team.
* [Beats](https://github.com/elastic/beats) — The lightweight shippers of the Elastic Stack. I'm actively contributing as a member of the maintaining team.
* [Catberry.js](https://catberry.github.io/) — isomorphic framework for building universal front-end apps using components, Flux architecture and [progressive rendering](https://youtu.be/aRaQe9n1lPk). Also, lots of plugins and libraries in the related [GitHub organization](https://github.com/catberry). I started it in 2014, used it at work but currently the project is no longer maintained.
