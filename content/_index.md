# Hello, World!

My name is [Denis](/about) and I'm a principal software engineer based in Germany.

In this blog I publish some thoughts and stories about things I'm interested in, such as:

* [Information security](/posts/tech/security/) or [tech](/posts/tech/) in general
* [Music](/posts/music/)
* [Motorcycles](/posts/motorcycle/)
* [Sport](/posts/sport/)
