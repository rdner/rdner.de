I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of the anime and went to see the movie. Although I didn&amp;rsquo;t like how the story was changed, I appreciated the visuals and the original soundtrack.

The idea was to express in music how one would feel inside a busy computer processing signals and working hard. The focus was definitely on the percussion.
Just to manage your expectations: I had never produced any electronic music before I worked on this. I didn&amp;rsquo;t try to match a certain genre or mimic someone, also most of the samples are taken from existing libraries.</description></item></channel></rss>
