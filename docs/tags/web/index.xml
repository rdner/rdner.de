&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m not a security expert, please check every word I write.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Although, I have some experience in basic pen-testing and I have exposed some vulnerabilities in the past, I don&amp;rsquo;t consider myself an expert in this area. There are people out there whose full-time job is information security and I&amp;rsquo;m not going to pretend I&amp;rsquo;m one of them. I just do some &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag#Computer_security">CTFs&lt;/a> as a hobby and build software as my daily job, so it gives me enough knowledge to write such articles and give such talks but does not make me an expert.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
