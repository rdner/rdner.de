Although, I have some experience in basic pen-testing and I have exposed some vulnerabilities in the past, I don&amp;rsquo;t consider myself an expert in this area. There are people out there whose full-time job is information security and I&amp;rsquo;m not going to pretend I&amp;rsquo;m one of them. I just do some CTFs as a hobby and build software as my daily job, so it gives me enough knowledge to write such articles and give such talks but does not make me an expert.</description></item></channel></rss>
