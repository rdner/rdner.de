In &lt;a href="../chasing-perfect-guitar">my previous&lt;/a> post I promised to write about the &lt;a href="https://strandbergguitars.com/">.strandberg*&lt;/a> guitar I had ordered because it definitely deserved a separate post. Well, here we go! I’m going to share all my thoughts on .strandberg* Boden OS7, all the up/down sides I found and how I fixed what I didn’t like and eventually got a perfect guitar for myself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A short disclaimer: this post is my personal opinion and nobody paid me for this.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Chasing a perfect guitar</title><link>https://rdner.de/posts/music/chasing-perfect-guitar/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Dec 2016 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://rdner.de/posts/music/chasing-perfect-guitar/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>A guitar or its sound is a very subjective topic, I don’t claim that I know the best about guitars and any related gear, everything is written here is my personal opinion according to my preferences and experience (which I don’t have much, for sure).&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="how-it-started">How it started&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Can’t remember exactly, when my parents bought me my first guitar but I have this picture from May 20th, 2005 where I play my first guitar ever.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
