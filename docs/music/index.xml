&lt;p>I wrote the first version in March 2020 for my custom baritone guitar. The guitar tuning is actually Dropped A (A E A D F# B).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At that time I was still unsatisfied with some parts and took a break for some time. Later I was returning to writing now and then, and at some point it seemed finished. When it came to recording guitar, I really struggled. You see, I’m not practicing guitar that much. I use it as my music-writing instrument, but I’m not a good guitar player. It was very tough for me to play these parts, and this track turned out to be harder to record than I anticipated. I tried a few times but was never satisfied with the results. So, I abandoned this idea completely.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cyber City</title><link>https://rdner.de/music/cyber-city-single/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Apr 2017 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><author>denis@rdner.de (Denis Rechkunov)</author><guid>https://rdner.de/music/cyber-city-single/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been a big fan of the 
&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113568/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">Ghost in the Shell&lt;/a> anime for a long time. I also really liked the 
&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0346314/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">Stand Alone Complex&lt;/a> show. So, when I learned that there would be a movie, I was very excited. I had so many ideas of what it could be, so many high expectations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I went to see the movie and got very disappointed in the story the filmmakers chose to tell in 
&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1219827/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">Ghost in the Shell&lt;/a> movie. Instead of taking a risk and telling a new story in that universe, they just took the best things from the original anime and the show I mentioned above and created a monster. Oh, well. At least visually, it was great.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Space</title><link>https://rdner.de/music/space-single/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Oct 2016 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><author>denis@rdner.de (Denis Rechkunov)</author><guid>https://rdner.de/music/space-single/</guid><description>&lt;p>This single is my first ever finished work with live guitars.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What I used:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Guitar: Gibson SG Standard&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bass: Ibanez SR300EB-CA&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Guitar FX: Zoom G3&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>Inside The Machine</title><link>https://rdner.de/music/inside-the-machine-album/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2015 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><author>denis@rdner.de (Denis Rechkunov)</author><guid>https://rdner.de/music/inside-the-machine-album/</guid><description>&lt;p>This album is my first ever experiment with producing music. The idea was to express in music how one would feel inside a busy computer processing signals and working hard. The focus was definitely on the percussion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Just to manage your expectations: I had never produced any electronic music before I worked on this. I didn&amp;rsquo;t try to match a certain genre or mimic someone, also most of the samples are taken from existing libraries.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
