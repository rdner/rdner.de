&lt;p>First, who am I to even talk about it? What is my background?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been building software for the last 15 years. I&amp;rsquo;ve worked at 8 companies ranging from small startups to one of the biggest tech companies in the world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the moment I primarily work on 
&lt;a href="https://github.com/elastic/beats" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Elastic Beats">Beats&lt;/a>. A few facts about this repository (July 2025):&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>~15 teams work on it&lt;/li>
&lt;li>918 unique contributors (including external ones)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>4,183 Go files&lt;/li>
&lt;li>653,168 lines of code&lt;/li>
&lt;li>45,205 pull requests&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>So, it&amp;rsquo;s a relatively big project with quite a few people working on it. Let&amp;rsquo;s take my path from onboarding to the present day as an example for this article.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Battle</title><link>https://rdner.de/music/the-battle-single/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><author>denis@rdner.de (Denis Rechkunov)</author><guid>https://rdner.de/music/the-battle-single/</guid><description>&lt;p>This track was very long in the making.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I wrote the first version in March 2020 for my custom baritone guitar. The guitar tuning is actually Dropped A (A E A D F# B).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At that time I was still unsatisfied with some parts and took a break for some time. Later I was returning to writing now and then, and at some point it seemed finished. When it came to recording guitar, I really struggled. You see, I’m not practicing guitar that much. I use it as my music-writing instrument, but I’m not a good guitar player. It was very tough for me to play these parts, and this track turned out to be harder to record than I anticipated. I tried a few times but was never satisfied with the results. So, I abandoned this idea completely.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My road to IRONMAN 70.3</title><link>https://rdner.de/posts/sport/im-70.3/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>denis@rdner.de (Denis Rechkunov)</author><guid>https://rdner.de/posts/sport/im-70.3/</guid><description>&lt;p>It was a typical weekend of 2018 when I went to see a new movie. As usual, the movie theatre played a few commercials and trailers before the actual movie started. This was one of the played commercials:&lt;/p>

 &lt;/div>

&lt;p>First, you see a woman who is training for a triathlon race and apparently her family, particularly her daughter, does not really understand why she is wasting so much time on it instead of being with her family. But then the story unfolds: we start seeing that this woman was in a tragic accident where she barely survived and lost her leg. Eventually, her daughter understands the &amp;ldquo;why&amp;rdquo; and realises how important it is for her mum and how important it is to support her.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why run?</title><link>https://rdner.de/posts/sport/why-run/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>denis@rdner.de (Denis Rechkunov)</author><guid>https://rdner.de/posts/sport/why-run/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="short-answer">

&lt;p>The short answer is:&lt;/p>

 Long Answer&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="undecorated heading-anchor" href="#long-answer">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I always hesitated to give a long answer in person. Mainly, because it required me to communicate so many things in a short amount of time and, most likely, I would not be able to find the best words to do so. Fortunately, smart people invented writing which allows us to be better at choosing the best words.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Paranoid Habits.

Bragging facts: at the moment I&amp;rsquo;ve visited 15 countries and 32 places, spent in total 102 days traveling. Since I got my motorbike license, I had 2 trips that went particularly well: 
&lt;a href="https://rdner.de/posts/motorbike/lanzarote">Lanzarote&lt;/a> and this one – Granada in Spain. What&amp;rsquo;s different? This time my wife and I rented a motorbike and went exploring. In fact, it went so well with Lanzarote that in Granada we even took a guided tour from a local company (details later) and started filming our trip on camera (only pictures before). What a beautiful footage&amp;rsquo;s come out! It was totally worth doing.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My automated backups to AWS S3 with client-side AES256</title><link>https://rdner.de/posts/tech/security/s3-aes256-backups/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>denis@rdner.de (Denis Rechkunov)</author><guid>https://rdner.de/posts/tech/security/s3-aes256-backups/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="what-i-was-looking-for-requirements">

&lt;p>The reason I didn&amp;rsquo;t just start using some backup software with built-in encryption is a pure lack of trust. So, if you&amp;rsquo;re fine with someone managing your backups, you might think the approach described here is a total overkill. And it&amp;rsquo;s okay. But there are some people out there who have the same trust issues that I do and they might find this article useful, so I write it for them. And also for myself, as a write-up what I did.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Paranoid Habits.
