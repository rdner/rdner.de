&lt;p>First, who am I to even talk about it? What is my background?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been building software for the last 15 years. I&amp;rsquo;ve worked at 8 companies ranging from small startups to one of the biggest tech companies in the world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the moment I primarily work on 
&lt;a href="https://github.com/elastic/beats" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Elastic Beats">Beats&lt;/a>. A few facts about this repository (July 2025):&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>~15 teams work on it&lt;/li>
&lt;li>918 unique contributors (including external ones)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>4,183 Go files&lt;/li>
&lt;li>653,168 lines of code&lt;/li>
&lt;li>45,205 pull requests&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When I was studying at Altay State Technical University in the small town Barnaul in Russia we used to think about ourselves as engineers not just developers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The educational system in Russia was very different in comparison with the western system at that point. We didn’t have Bachelor’s or Master’s degree we had a qualification level and in my case it was “Engineer in software development and automated systems”.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
