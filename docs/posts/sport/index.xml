As usual, the movie theatre played a few commercials and trailers before the actual movie started. This was one of the played commercials:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>First, you see a woman who is training for a triathlon race and apparently her family, particularly her daughter, does not really understand why she is wasting so much time on it instead of being with her family. But then the story unfolds: we start seeing that this woman was in a tragic accident where she barely survived and lost her leg.

&lt;p>I always hesitated to give a long answer in person.
