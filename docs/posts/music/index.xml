&lt;p>This track was very long in the making.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I wrote the first version in March 2020 for my custom baritone guitar. The guitar tuning is actually Dropped A (A E A D F# B).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At that time I was still unsatisfied with some parts and took a break for some time. Later I was returning to writing now and then, and at some point it seemed finished. When it came to recording guitar, I really struggled. You see, I’m not practicing guitar that much. I use it as my music-writing instrument, but I’m not a good guitar player. It was very tough for me to play these parts, and this track turned out to be harder to record than I anticipated. I tried a few times but was never satisfied with the results. So, I abandoned this idea completely.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cyber City</title><link>https://rdner.de/posts/music/cyber-city-single/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Apr 2017 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://rdner.de/posts/music/cyber-city-single/</guid><description>&lt;div style="display: block;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width:50%">

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been a big fan of the &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113568/">Ghost in the Shell&lt;/a> anime for a long time. I also really liked the &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0346314/">Stand Alone Complex&lt;/a> show. So, when I learned that there would be a movie, I was very excited. I had so many ideas of what it could be, so many high expectations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I went to see the movie and got very disappointed in the story the filmmakers chose to tell in &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1219827/">Ghost in the Shell&lt;/a> movie. Instead of taking a risk and telling a new story in that universe, they just took the best things from the original anime and the show I mentioned above and created a monster. Oh, well. At least visually, it was great.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>.strandberg* Boden OS7 — my perfect guitar</title><link>https://rdner.de/posts/music/strandberg-boden-os-7/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://rdner.de/posts/music/strandberg-boden-os-7/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hey, everyone! In &lt;a href="../chasing-perfect-guitar">my previous&lt;/a> post I promised to write about the &lt;a href="https://strandbergguitars.com/">.strandberg*&lt;/a> guitar I had ordered because it definitely deserved a separate post. Well, here we go! I’m going to share all my thoughts on .strandberg* Boden OS7, all the up/down sides I found and how I fixed what I didn’t like and eventually got a perfect guitar for myself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A short disclaimer: this post is my personal opinion and nobody paid me for this.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Chasing a perfect guitar</title><link>https://rdner.de/posts/music/chasing-perfect-guitar/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Dec 2016 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://rdner.de/posts/music/chasing-perfect-guitar/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>A guitar or its sound is a very subjective topic, I don’t claim that I know the best about guitars and any related gear, everything is written here is my personal opinion according to my preferences and experience (which I don’t have much, for sure).&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="how-it-started">How it started&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Can’t remember exactly, when my parents bought me my first guitar but I have this picture from May 20th, 2005 where I play my first guitar ever.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Space</title><link>https://rdner.de/posts/music/space-single/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Oct 2016 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://rdner.de/posts/music/space-single/</guid><description>&lt;div style="display: block;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width:50%">

&lt;p>This single is my first ever finished work with live guitars.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What I used:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Guitar: Gibson SG Standard&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bass: Ibanez SR300EB-CA&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Guitar FX: Zoom G3&lt;/li>

The idea was to express in music how one would feel inside a busy computer processing signals and working hard. The focus was definitely on the percussion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Just to manage your expectations: I had never produced any electronic music before I worked on this. I didn&amp;rsquo;t try to match a certain genre or mimic someone, also most of the samples are taken from existing libraries.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
