I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of the anime and went to see the movie. Although I didn&amp;rsquo;t like how the story was changed, I appreciated the visuals and the original soundtrack.&lt;/p>

In &lt;a href="../chasing-perfect-guitar">my previous&lt;/a> post I promised to write about the &lt;a href="https://strandbergguitars.com/">.strandberg*&lt;/a> guitar I had ordered because it definitely deserved a separate post. Well, here we go! I’m going to share all my thoughts on .strandberg* Boden OS7, all the up/down sides I found and how I fixed what I didn’t like and eventually got a perfect guitar for myself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A short disclaimer: this post is my personal opinion and nobody paid me for this.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Chasing a perfect guitar</title><link>https://rdner.de/posts/music/chasing-perfect-guitar/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Dec 2016 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://rdner.de/posts/music/chasing-perfect-guitar/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>A guitar or its sound is a very subjective topic, I don’t claim that I know the best about guitars and any related gear, everything is written here is my personal opinion according to my preferences and experience (which I don’t have much, for sure).&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="how-it-started">How it started&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Can’t remember exactly, when my parents bought me my first guitar but I have this picture from May 20th, 2005 where I play my first guitar ever.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Space</title><link>https://rdner.de/posts/music/space-single/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Oct 2016 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://rdner.de/posts/music/space-single/</guid><description>&lt;p>This single is my first ever finished work playing guitar.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Guitar: Gibson SG Standard&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bass: Ibanez SR300EB-CA&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Guitar FX: Zoom G3&lt;/li>

The idea was to express in music how one would feel inside a busy computer processing signals and working hard. The focus was definitely on the percussion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Just to manage your expectations: I had never produced any electronic music before I worked on this. I didn&amp;rsquo;t try to match a certain genre or mimic someone, also most of the samples are taken from existing libraries.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
