Bragging facts: at the moment I&amp;rsquo;ve visited 15 countries and 32 places, spent in total 102 days traveling. Since I got my motorbike license, I had 2 trips that went particularly well: &lt;a href="../../posts/motorbike/lanzarote">Lanzarote&lt;/a> and this one â€“ Granada in Spain. What&amp;rsquo;s different? This time my wife and I rented a motorbike and went exploring. In fact, it went so well with Lanzarote that in Granada we even took a guided tour from a local company (details later) and started filming our trip on camera (only pictures before). What a beautiful footage&amp;rsquo;s come out! It was totally worth doing.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Riding on Lanzarote, Spain</title><link>https://rdner.de/posts/motorcycle/lanzarote/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://rdner.de/posts/motorcycle/lanzarote/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is the first time we went somewhere after I got my motorbike license, so &amp;ldquo;why not rent a bike and explore the whole island by riding together&amp;rdquo; we thought. Now, looking back, I&amp;rsquo;d say it was a bit sketchy because I had not have enough experience riding in mountains before but, in the end, it went well, I was very careful and didn&amp;rsquo;t try to ride above my abilities.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
